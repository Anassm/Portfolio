## My projects
- [`TODO-list website design` Small website I made in React-JS.](https://github.com/Anassm/todolist)
- [`Coming soon` More websites in the making.. Coming soon.](https://github.com/Anassm)

Currently following Scrimba React-JS courses. As I haven't showed much of my JavaScript capabilities,<br>
I will be applying more of my JavaScript knowledge into my next project, which will be used as an API for my first portfolio website!
